# MAnim Experimentation with Video Generation

Experimenting with the MAnim library for generating video animations.

## Notes

- Solid library that works really well at what it does
- Scenes feel very "on-track" in that it is a sequence of steps one followed by the next
- Python allows for re-use to create common elements like an isometric file
- Works great for scenes where the emphasis is on the core "shapes" and animation


Don't think this fits with the use-case I'm after. Would make more sense to explore as a unity "game" that is really just an interactive cutscene. As that would allow for elements of the scene to still remain dynamic (animated) while the core "state" of the animation remains at a fixed point in time.
